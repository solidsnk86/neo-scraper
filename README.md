# neo-scraper
Neo-Scraper is an application made with Flask, Python, Beautifulsoup to do a web-scraping at any page which are made by React.

>[!Note]
>If you wanna use this app, you need to install all these dependencies:

- Falsk
```bash
pip install Flask
```

```bash
pip isntall flask-cors
```
- Selenium
```bash
pip install selenium
```
- Requests
```bash
pip install requests

pip install beautifulsoup4
```
Or if you want to install all the modules, I created a `requirements.txt` file. To execute you must open the terminal and enter the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On the other hand, we need to execute the virtual server.
